I made this website in Summer break. This E-Commerce web portal is designed by using several languages like PHP, MYSQL(for database), 
HTML, CSS and a little use of javaScript and jQuery. Well it is almost ready to run on server as i created Back-end with Front-end. 
It has several features like by using admin rights one can add :-
Brands,
Categories,
Products to the database
They are also editable.
